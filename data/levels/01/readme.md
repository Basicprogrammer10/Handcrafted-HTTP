### Challenge #01⏎
<br/>

When you need to *get* data from a server you will use a **GET** request. In this first challenge you will need to retrieve data from the path `/`<br><br/>

How do even structure a request in the first place?<br>Well that follows this basic structure:

> <METHOD> <PATH> <VERSION><br><HEADERS><br><br><BODY>

- The **METHOD** is like the *operation* you want to execute
- The **PATH** is the *place* you are making this request to, think of a file path on your computer.
- The **VERSION** is just the version of HTTP the request is in. This will always be *HTTP/1.1* in our case.
- The **BODY** is for sending data to the servr. Don't worry about it... for now.

> Things get a little *wackier* from here

You now want to see *how poor* you are.
You want to use *[BANK NAME]s* **COBOL API** to check, but it requires an *authentication token*.

You can get said *authentication token* from `/auth` with a **POST** request.

You will need to supply the username and password in the **BODY**.
For this chalange we will use the following Login Details.
- **Username:** Nelly
- **Password:** password123!

### Challenge #02‚èé
<br/>

> A **POST** request, in simple terms, is a way for you to *send* data to a destination with the help of the internet.

When you need to **send** data to a server you will use a **POST** request.

<br/>
In this challenge you will need to send the data `Hello World` to the path `/api`.
Use what you learned in the first challenge!

<br/>
Make sure your data is in the correct format, or the server may not accept it.

> Hint: you need to worry about that `<BODY>` now.

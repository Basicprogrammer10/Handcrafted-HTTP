### Challenge #02⏎

> A **POST** request, in simple terms, is a way for you to _send_ data to a destination with the help of the internet.

When you need to **send** data to a server, you will use a **POST** request.

<br/>
In this challenge, you will need to send the data `Hello World` to the path `/api`.
Use what you learned in the first challenge!

> Hint: you need to worry about that `<BODY>` now.

The **BODY** section of an HTTP request is where you can put data to send to the server.
They go 2 lines after the headers. This is where you'll want to attach `Hello World`

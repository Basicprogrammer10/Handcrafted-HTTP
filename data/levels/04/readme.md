### Challenge #04‚èé
<br/>

The server gave the following response:
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>Server: afire/0.2.2<br><br>K28x4spWnd

As you can see your request went through successfully and you got your token! (**K28x4spWnd**)

<br/>
Now you can send the *authentication token* with a **GET** request to `/api/balance`, and then *FINALLY* see how poor you are!

<br/>
To do this we will use a **Header**.

> Headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response

They have a *Key* and a *Value* separated by a `:`.
